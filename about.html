                I'm 28 years old and from the San Francisco Bay Area.
                At the start of the pandemic, I dived deeply into Python, SQL, and Data Science. 
                Now I'm studying more front-end development including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
                Later, my goals in my no particular order: a lower-level language such as C or C#, 
                large scale data engineering with AWS, Apache Airflow, Docker and Kubernetes, 
                as well as modern javascript frameworks like Node and React, and perhaps a modern language like Rust or Go. </p>

                <p>I recently accepted my admission to Oregon State for their post baccalaureate computer science program, 
                and will be studying there for a year and a half. I'm excited for the opportunity to further my career with them. As I started to code, I realized that I get a great endorphin rush from solving programming problems. This mechanic lets me obsess over code. 
                Eventually, I want to become a knowledgable, capable programmer. I want to help fellow students, I'd like to develop interesting applications, and I'd like the opportunity to have an internship.

                In my free time, I like playing chess. I've played for over ten years now (over 13,000 games on chess.com) and have achieved a 2100 rating. 
                Go check out my Chess Statistics project for more information, and feel free to e-mail me with questions.
                I used to play a number of other sports, including basketball, baseball, and football. 
                Recently, I've started thru-hiking and jui jitsu. I guess that makes me a total hipster.

               I have a 2 year old German Shepherd named Lotus. She's now 85 pounds, long body with short legs. She can be aloof and 
               demands respect from dog and people alike. It's been a treat to have her during the quaratine, I've never felt the same loneliness during the pandemic with her. 
               I love her dearly. 
            </p>
