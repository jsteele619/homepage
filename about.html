                I'm a 28 year old man from the San Francisco Bay Area.
                One year ago, I started learning programming for a career. I dived deeply into Python, SQL, and Data Science. I realized that I get a great endorphin rush from solving programming problems.
                Now I'm studying front-end development including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I want to become a knowledgable, capable programmer.</p>

                <p>I recently accepted my admission to Oregon State for their post baccalaureate computer science program, 
                and will be studying there for a year and a half. I'm excited for the opportunity to further my career with them.

                In my free time, I like playing chess. I've played for over ten years now and have achieved a 2100 rating. 
                I used to play a number of other sports, including basketball, baseball, and football. 
                Recently, I've started rock climbing, biking, and jui jitsu. I guess that makes me a total hipster.

               I have a 2 year old German Shepherd named Lotus. She's 85 pounds, long body with short legs. She can be aloof and 
               demands respect from dog and people alike. It's been a treat to have her during the quaratine, I've never felt the same loneliness with her. 
               I love her dearly.
